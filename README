The goal is to be a drop-in replacement of ONScripter-EN.
For a reference of the NScripter API this implements, see:
http://unclemion.com/onscripter/api/NScrAPI.html

To try nPyONScripter out, you need to have python and pygame. Any python 2 version starting from 2.6 should work.
Additionally, it currently requires that the target game be extracted.
To extract, you need the ONScripter tools from any of these sources:
http://unclemion.com/onscripter/releases/
http://nscripter.insani.org/sdk.html

To use, just cd to the directory of the game you want to play and run "python /path/to/npynscr/pynscr_pygame.py".

Changelog:
2013-08-17 Uploaded to github. Tsukihime is playable if its files are extracted beforehand with ONScripter tools.
